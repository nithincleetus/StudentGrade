# StudentGrade
Student grade analysis using R
In this study, we will use various data science techniques and approaches to ‘Students
Grade’ dataset to analyse students’ performance based on the various features available.
Dataset is in the form of a csv file student_grades.csv. There
are a total of 31 characteristics in the dataset, with a total of 395 samples. The goal variable
is "Pass," which indicates whether or not the student passed the exam. We will attempt to
analyse and find out the most important features which contribute to a student passing or
failing the assessment.
